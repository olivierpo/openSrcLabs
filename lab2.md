It is important for open source software to have a license because that is a requirment for it to be officially recognized as open source. It is also important to have a license so that you can use it for commecial purposes or sell it.

You shouldn't jump on a project that doesn't have an explicit license because the owner of the project reserves all rights to it. Without a license, you cannot distribute your modified version in order to "help your neighbor." 

I agree that the failure to make Gopher open source was the cause for its demise. In fact, because the Web had such a vast number of people working on it versus the small team that Gopher had, it was able to advance in leaps and bounds.  

Microsoft uses the MIT license for .NET because the MIt license puts very limited restrictions on reuse of code and software, which .NET needs because it is open source in order to be easily worked on for different platforms.


When thinking of the EVE online market simulation website project, the License that feels best fits is the MIT license because it is simple and permissive. For such a project, i wouldn't be concerned about patents, nor would i be concerned about sharing improvements.

GPL is best for the common good because it forces people who use your open source software in their software to make their software also licensed under GPL, which makes their software open source as well. This makes it so that any software using your software always has to show their source code. LGPL is the best for developpers, because people can use your software in proprietary stuff, guaranteeing that your software is more widely distributed, but also if they modify your source code, they need to show the modifications. BSD is best for a company, because itis the most simple of the licenses. When you use this license, anyone can use your code for anything, and doesn't need to give anything back.

AutoRoute -> MIT

A project that i think would be interesting is making a bot that could play an online game, notably Hearthstone. It would be a piece of software that would be designed to be able to beat other players in a competitive card game setting. For this software, we would use the MIT license because it is concise and we do not need concern ourselves with patent issues.
